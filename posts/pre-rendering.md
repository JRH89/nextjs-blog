# Props

In the world of React, passing props between components is a fundamental concept that allows for effective communication and data sharing. Props, short for properties, enable the transfer of data from parent components to their child components. Understanding how to pass props correctly can greatly enhance your React development skills. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of passing props from parent to child components using React JS.

## What are Props?

Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to its child component(s). They are essentially read-only and cannot be modified by the child component. Props are often used to customize and configure child components based on specific requirements.

## Passing Props from Parent to Child

To pass props from a parent component to a child component, you simply need to include the desired value as an attribute when rendering the child component. 

The greeting prop is passed to ChildComponent with the value "Hello, World!".

To access the passed prop within the child component, you can use the props object.

## Conclusion

Passing props in React is a fundamental mechanism for sharing data between components. By understanding how to pass and access props, you can create more flexible and reusable components in your React applications. Props flow from parent to child, allowing you to customize and configure child components based on specific needs.
